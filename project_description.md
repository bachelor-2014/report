# Project Description

Recently EU has granted 2.8million euros to a project for advancement of
artificial life. This project has several parts, this report will
focus on parts of the hardware platform used to support this project.
The platform will be refered to as Evolutionary Robotic Platform (ERP).

This report is written by 3 bachelor students on the IT-University of
Copenhagen as their bachelor thesis. 

With our project we wish to achieve some or all the below
points

* Setup of operating system and application environment on Beagle board 
* Interaction with camera through the use of OpenCV
* Write drivers for the different hardware parts of the platform
  (motors, sensors)
* Interface to motor operation in a basic capacity
* An easy-to-use API for the above. Wrapped in a library for easy
  installation
* (optionally) Domain specific language (DSL) on top of the above API

Furthermore we will investigate and elaborate on the OpenCV part of
the project to extract relevant information from the images captured
with the camera attached
