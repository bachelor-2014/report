# Project Description

Recently EU has granted â‚¬2.8 million to a project for advancement of
artificial life. The project consists of several parts, one of which is located
at the IT University of Copenhagen. This is the context in which our bachelor
project takes place.

Our bachelor project will focus on a hardware platform being developed as part
of the project; a construction consisting of small electric motors and different
sensors capable of moving petri dishes and mixing liquids in these, using the
sensors to record the results of mixing the liquids in real time. The platform
will be refered to as Evolutionary Robotic Platform (ERP).

With our project we wish to achieve some or all the below
points

* Setup of operating system and application environment on Beagle board 
* Interaction with camera (sensor) through the use of OpenCV
* Write drivers for the different hardware parts of the platform
  (motors, sensors)
* Interface to motor operation for basic operations
* Create an easy-to-use API for the above. Wrapped in a library for easy
  installation
* (optionally) Create a domain specific language (DSL) on top of the above API

The largest part of the project will focus on the use of OpenCV to extract
relevant information from the images captured with the camera attached.
