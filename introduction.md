#Introduction
This report is the Bachelor thesis being the result our work from the 1st of
February to the 23rd of May 2014 as part of our Bachelor in Software Development
at the IT University of Copenhagen.

//TODO verify dates

The project consists of work under the topic of both electronics and hardware
and the topic of software development. Our education focuses entirely on
software development, which therefore is also the focus of the report. Our
considerations concerning the hardware of the robot are also included in this
report, but they are less detailed for the reason explained above.
