#Managing experiment data
\label{sec:experiment_data}

Having a platform for conducting experiments requires a bridge between the scientist
designing the experiment and the results from the experiments. It is the most noble
of tasks for a platform such as the EvoBot to not only extract this data but also to
aid the designer in understanding what is actually found in her experiments.
