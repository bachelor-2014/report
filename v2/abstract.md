\chapter*{Abstract}

The EVOBLISS project is a EU-wide cooperative endeavour to advance the
development of artificial life research. One of the chief components
in this feat is the development of an evolutionary robotic platform of
which the first prototype, Splotbot, has been built. This paper
describes the advancement against the second iteration of the
prototype by solving specific shortcomings which have been voiced by
the members of the EVOBLISS project, as well as advancing the current
prototype in key aspects already present. This is done by building on
the existing work done on the Splotbot platform to make a completely
new prototype while thoroughly documenting the important design
decisions and suggesting improvements where applicable. The result is
a functioning prototype that improves the platform in key areas such
as user interface and autonomous capabilities as well as proves the
feasibility of key aspects such as running the platform completely
standalone and scanning and stitching large areas in linear time. This
paper should serve as provide key insights and solid recommendations
for the next stages of the EVOBLISS project.
