\chapter*{Abstract}

The EVOBLISS project is an E.U. wide cooperative endeavour to advance
the development of artificial life research. One of the components in
this feat is the development of an evolutionary robotic platform of
which the first prototype, Splotbot, has been built. This paper
describes the advancement towards the second iteration of the
prototype by solving specific shortcomings which have been voiced by
the members of the EVOBLISS project, as well as improving the current
prototype in key aspects already present. This is done by building on
the existing work done on the Splotbot platform to make a completely
new prototype while thoroughly documenting the important design
decisions and suggesting improvements where applicable. The result is
a functioning prototype, EvoBot, that improves the platform in key
areas such as user interface and autonomous capabilities as well as
proving the feasibility of key aspects such as running the platform
completely standalone and scanning large areas using image stitching
techniques. This paper seeks to provide key insights and solid
recommendations for the next stages of development of the robotic
platform.
