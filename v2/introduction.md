# Introduction

## Background and motivation

Forefront of research
Investigation brought on by EU
Need for automation and efficiency

Expressed wish for modularity
Expressed wish for vision functionality

## Scope of the project

This project is a product of past research, see \ref{past_projects}. 
Building on this past knowledge this projects seeks to be an investigative design
project aiming for two overall goals:

1. The feasibility of our proposed design
2. Feasibility of specific additions to the existing functionality

The feasibility will be measured by implementing the design and assess the success
of the implementation.


## End result

- An investigative report concluding whether or not the proposed design
is feasible accompanied by a functional prototype of the design.
- A proposal of an alternative design, if applicable
- A thorough review of the findings over the course of the project, aiming
to objectively inform people carrying on the project about design choices and 
whether they are good or bad.
