#The existing robot
The existing SplotBot robotic platform is based very closely on the open source
RepRap 3D printer project. It is based on the RepRap Prusa Mendel model, of
which it reuses not only much of the hardware but also the microcontroller
firmware and software for communicating with the microcontroller
[@gutierrez2012, p. 15-20].

The RepRap project has as goal to make cheap 3D printing widely available by
being an open source community project focusing on building self-replicating 3D
printers; the printers are said to be self-replicating in that a finished
printer is capable of printing many of the parts used to build it [@reprap.org].

//TODO Describe the capabilities of the existing robot such as e.g. the
//experiments it is able to perform

##The hardware
The hardware of the robot is controlled by an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller.
